# Typing Animation Website

This project is a simple typing animation website that displays dynamic text with a typing effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animations are created using the [Typed.js](<https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/>) library.

## Demo

[Live Demo](#) - You can include a link to a live demo if you have deployed the website.

## Features

- **Typing Animation:** The website displays typing animations for various strings such as "Coder," "Programmer," "Web Designer," etc.
- **Auto-Typed Text:** It also includes a paragraph that dynamically types out a descriptive paragraph about your skills and achievements.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout and animations.
- **JavaScript (Typed.js)**: For creating the typing animation effect.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/typing-animation-website.git>

```

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd typing-animation-website
    
    ```
    
2. **Open `index.html` in your Browser:**
    
    You can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the typing animation in action.
    

## Usage

- Modify the strings in the `index.js` file to customize the text being typed.
- Adjust the `typeSpeed` and `backSpeed` properties to change the typing speed.
- Customize the design by editing the `style.css` file.

## Code Overview

### HTML Structure

```html
<div class="container">
    <h1><span class="fixed">I'm</span> <span class="auto-type"></span></h1>
    <p><span class="auto-typed"></span></p>
</div>

```

### CSS Styling

- The `.container` class centers the content vertically and horizontally.
- The `.auto-type` class styles the text that is dynamically typed in the heading.
- The overall design uses a dark theme with a contrasting highlight for the typed text.

### JavaScript for Typing Animation

```jsx
let typed = new Typed(".auto-type", {
  strings: ["Coder", "Programmer", "Web designer", "Video Editor"],
  typeSpeed: 100,
  backSpeed: 50,
  loop: true,
  fadeout: true,
  fadeOutDelay: 500,
});

let typed2 = new Typed(".auto-typed", {
  strings: [
    "You are an ambitious and skilled individual...",
    "...engaging a growing audience.",
  ],
  typeSpeed: 40,
  backSpeed: 50,
  loop: true,
  fadeout: true,
  fadeOutDelay: 500,
});
